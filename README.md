# Number Guessing Game

This is the problem link: https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game

## Run the game

1. Open Terminal.
2. Enter the command: `python Number.py`.
3. Play Game!

## How the Code Works:

1. Welcome Message: Displays a welcome message and game rules.
2. Difficulty Levels: Users can select a difficulty level, which determines the number of guesses allowed.
3. Random Number Generation: The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
4. User Input: The user enters their guesses. The program gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Attempts Tracking: It counts the number of attempts and provides the time to guess the correct number.
6. Play Again Option: After each game, the user can choose to play again or exit.

## Features to Enhance

- Hint System: You can implement a hind system to provide additional clues if the user is struggling.
- High Score Tracking: You can add functionality to track the fewest attempts for each difficulty level.
